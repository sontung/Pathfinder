Hi there, my name is Tung!
I am a third year student at HAMK University. 
This app is for one of my side projects controlling
an exploring rover (same idea with NASA pathfinder)
I am currently living in Finland. I enjoy building
robots and making games in spare time. This app
is completely designed and programmed by me.
